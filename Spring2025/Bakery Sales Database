# Bakery Sales Database

This project is a *Bakery Sales Database developed in Microsoft Access (or LibreOffice Base) as part of Module 12coursework. The goal is to import, clean, organize, and analyze sales data from a bakeryâ€™s past order records. The project demonstrates intermediate data management skills including external file import, data cleaning, query creation, and generating summary totals.
