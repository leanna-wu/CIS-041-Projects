# Customer & Orders Database
This project is a relational database built using Microsoft Access (or LibreOffice Base), designed to manage and analyze customer and order data. The database integrates multiple tables, defines relationships, and demonstrates intermediate database concepts such as data sorting, filtering, querying, report generation, and total calculations. 

This project was developed as part of the coursework for Unit 12: Relational Database Management.

## Key Features

- Data Entry Forms: Easy-to-use interfaces for entering and managing customer and order records.
- Data Sorting & Filtering: Built-in sorting by name/date and filtering by customer or order amount.
- Orders Query: A query named `Orders Query` extracts:
